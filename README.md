This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Simple React API Project

This is a simple Project using React to build a Single Page Application to display a Random List of Contacts.

### What I Learned

- Using React to build a Single Page Application
- Making API Calls
- Displaying JSON Data on a Dynamic Web Page

## Comments

I plan on changing the used API to a more complex one and style the Front-End further to eventually add user input for customizeable queries.

##Commands

# starting the app for development
npm start
npm run start
yarn start

# building the app for production
